    <release version="3.5.0" date="2019-07-01">
      <description>
        <p>New features:</p>

          <li>mDNS discovery support on Windows, Mac and Linux. Chromebook support will be added later.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Soundflower rework. Improved installation logic, to accommodate macOS security</li>
          <li>Manual mode rework. Only the next streaming session will be in manual mode now. If you want to always stream in manual mode, there is a trigger for that.</li>
          <li>Linux improvements. Application will install from snap package.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Important bug fixes</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Others:</p>

          <li>SSDP packets TTL value is now 255. Should make it easier to send discovery packets across multiple VLANs</li>
          <li>"Ignore certificate error" option was added to settings. If you have internal dashboard with insecure certificate set as digital signage, new Airtame browser won't show it because of security settings. To bypass, use the option in the settings.</li>
